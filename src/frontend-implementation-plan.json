        "If the user attempts to use Web Search Ultra (e.g., clicks a button in that placeholder), the UI shows a clear “Coming Soon” toast/message instead of failing silently."

Ensure selecting this tab does not trigger any search fetching logic by disabling the existing useSearchContent query when the active tab is Web Search Ultra (e.g., avoid enabling the query by passing an empty search term or otherwise gating it for this tab). Add a clear call-to-action button in the placeholder (e.g., “Try Web Search Ultra”) that, when clicked, shows a “Coming Soon” toast/message using the existing toast system instead of performing any real action. Use the existing shadcn-ui Tabs/Badge components and the existing toast utility for messaging; verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
