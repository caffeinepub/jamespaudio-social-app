The diff shows partial scaffolding for a new 'websearch' tab state (disabling search queries when activeTab === 'websearch'), but does not provide evidence (within the truncated content) that the UI includes a visible “Web Search Ultra (Coming Soon)” tab label, a placeholder explanation view, or a “Coming Soon” toast/message on attempted use.",

      "requirement": "When a user performs a search (submittedSearch is set and results UI is shown), the tab row includes a new tab for “Web Search Ultra” visibly marked “Coming Soon”.",
      "reason": "The truncated diff does not show any TabsList/TabsTrigger additions or any UI copy/Badge that labels a tab as “Web Search Ultra” and “Coming Soon”. Only a state check for activeTab !== 'websearch' is visible.",
