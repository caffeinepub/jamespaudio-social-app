      "text": "Update the Advanced Search Engine page (`frontend/src/pages/SearchEnginePage.tsx`) to include a new feature surfaced to users as **“Web Search Ultra”** and clearly labeled **“Coming Soon”**, representing a future capability to search the public web/news for current information.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "When a user performs a search (i.e., `submittedSearch` is set and results UI is shown), the tab row includes a new tab for Web Search Ultra that is visibly marked as “Coming Soon”.",
        "Selecting the Web Search Ultra tab shows a non-functional placeholder state (no backend calls) that explains in English that web/news search is coming soon.",
        "If the user attempts to use Web Search Ultra (e.g., clicks a button in that placeholder), the UI shows a clear “Coming Soon” toast/message instead of failing silently."

  "constraints": [
    "Frontend changes must not modify any files under `frontend/immutablePaths` (compose existing UI components instead).",
    "Do not implement real public web/news search or any external API integration as part of this request; this is a “Coming Soon” UI-only feature."
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Implementing real web search/news crawling, indexing, or external API requests",
    "Adding backend canister methods for web search",
    "Claiming or implying the feature “knows everything” in user-facing text (keep copy accurate and clearly labeled as Coming Soon)"
